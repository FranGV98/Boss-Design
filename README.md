# Video Game Boss Design

During this research work, I tried to find a formula that all video games had in common, but there is no complete study and written guidelines on how the bosses of each video game should be designed so far. Therefore I have decided that my work here was going to be to classify the different most popular concepts that have been made throughout the history of video games and what contributes each one to its respective title.


## History

The dungeon boss concept comes from the famous board role-playing games like "Dungeon & Dragons", this was an enemy that was different from others because it had more life and more power than any other enemy and that by default appeared at the end of the dungeon, being the last challenge to face. Once defeated, it is common to obtain a powerful item or some valuable item that rewards the player for having endeavored to defeat him.

As video games evolved and new concepts and mechanics were added, the final boss was introduced having a function similar to that of role-playing games. It is reflected with the same 1975 video game "dnd", which is a computer version of "Dungeon & Dragons".

A clear example of these bosses would be the famous Bowser of the Super Mario Bros saga that distinguished itself by being exclusively on the last level of each world and served as a barrier to access a new world.

Before we begin to analyze the different types of bosses, we are going to establish universal laws that each of them share or at least the majority.

They are the ultimate goal of the chapter / world / level of the video game in question. That is, it is the climax of these.

They differ from a normal enemy by being more powerful and unique.

The idea of ​​boss is to be a challenge that makes the player feel comforted by beating him since he has achieved a level of playing ability that has allowed him to defeat him thanks to his effort. This point is where many games fail and makes the boss not a good challenge.

I also want to clarify that in the same video game can have several bosses, being those who appear at the end of each world, and final boss who you have to defeat at the end of the video game and secret boss who has to meet some requirements to access it and whose defeat does not affect the course of the game. All these bosses fulfill a very similar function.


## Analysis of different bosses and their functions

To start analyzing the different bosses, what better way to start than with the king of bosses in terms of popularity.


### Bowser (Super Mario Bros) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpI_cKRLj0

Bowser's appearance is distinguished from the other enemies of the game, being more impressive since the first plumber's game. This is thanks to the fact that its size is larger than any other enemy and has a somewhat more complex pattern than all the goombas and koopas that we have defeated along the different levels that we have overcome.

Also, speaking about his role in the story, he is the main villain who kidnaps the princess and your goal in the game is to beat him and rescue Peach.

In the first game, at the end of each world we have a castle set for the boss in question. Each time you defeat him, he adds a variant to Bowser's pattern and therefore, in the last fight his pattern is the most complex of all and hardest to beat, but thanks to our skill we can defeat him by pressing the button behind him dodging their attacks and taking advantage of their jump.

In the following games, Bowser is reserved exclusively for the last level of all and other enemies superiors than normal ones are used as zone boss. 

As you can see in this graphic, bosses in Super Mario Bros 3 are used as climax point of each world and is used as a reference in the difficulty curve and after defeating each boss, the first level after that is easier to let the player relax after an stress moment.

The evolution of the battles against Bowser are a clear example of how bosses have evolved throughout history as a reference. We can see that in the 80s it was simply a more complex enemy that could only be defeated by pressing a button, in the 90s with Super Mario World it presents us with something more spectacular and lasting with a somewhat more cinematic tone than it had been previously and that I would give foot to the final boss as a show. In Super Mario 64 the formula evolves and Bowser plays with the environment and even a new mechanic is added since this is not a conventional enemy and can not be defeated by jumping on it if not to be thrown at bombs. From there the scenario + boss formula does nothing more than be polished and developed being the stage part of it.

From this villain we can say that it has the purpose of being spectacular, making a difference between the other enemies being impossible to kill in the conventional way and being the closing of the game.


### Bosses of The Legend of Zelda https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsaCjqqYuU

Throughout my research, I have seen many articles that define bosses as exams for the player in which they demonstrate what they have learned throughout what they have learned, but as we have seen before, Bowser usually introduces new mechanics to be differentiated from other enemies and therefore in the same combat is the process of learning and execution where you test your ability.

Instead, in The Legend of Zelda we have real exams at the end of each temple. As a general rule, in temples, we are given an object that introduces a new mechanic. Let's say the object is a bow with arrows, because throughout the temple the player will learn how to use it and what better way to know if you have mastered it than facing a boss who can only be defeated by shooting in one eye with the bow.

From my point of view, this boss model is perfect since in this way the player is rewarded for mastering all the mechanics.

The problem with this game is that these exam bosses really are subject bosses, being the final boss as a general rule Ganondorf, who does not ask you to know how to use any of the acquired objects, but simply to have skill with the sword and shield being able to help you with these objects. It would be great if he asked to use all these objects through different phases of the same enemy and end a final sword fight to show the player. But I guess Nintendo knows what it does and I'm not the one to deny it.


### Dark Souls Bosses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A44uvRS_pWU

Some time ago I tried to play this saga, but it ended my despair. So in this case I rely on what I read and see of others.

In Dark Souls, not all bosses are equal but they have in common the spectacular, the complexity of patterns superior to others and not in all cases are stage dependent but they do rely on it for their benefit, for example if we fight Against a slow enemy, the stage will be smaller so that we have less room for movement.

The game in this case rewards the effort to have achieved a powerful equipment to defeat the boss and, above all, rewards the skill acquired by having invested many hours.

In the case of this game, optional bosses abound, that is, that the player does not need to beat them to continue with the linear course of the game, but upon winning them he will receive a good reward that will facilitate his future.


### Gym Leaders and Champion (Pokémon) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbnUxwXkEOg

In Pokémon we have 8 gym leaders and in the league the champion who has the role of final boss.

Each gym is specialized in one type and therefore we will have to have a creature with movements that are effective before the gym in particular. At the end of each gym, we will have the leader, who differs from the others by having a larger team, at a higher level and therefore in some cases in a superior evolutionary way. This makes winning it more complicated and we are practically obliged to use the type table against it.

It is an example similar to that of Zelda, but without having any new mechanics, if on the routes near the gym there are many effective type Pokémon so that we catch them and use them to get the medal. In this way the player learns the type table in addition to forming a varied team so that he can face any challenge that lies ahead. The league champion has a balanced team in terms of types and rewards the player who has captured Pokémon of each type that can counter him.

In the majority of titles, the gymnastics fighting had a level of spectacularity practically null as there was almost no differentiating element other than the monothem of the day and that the level was somewhat higher. This ends in the eighth generation by introducing the mechanics of Dinamax that is exclusive of fighting against bosses and that allows this mechanics to be in a special scenario for combat. The climax of the show in this game would be the fight against Eternatus Gigamax, which lacks difficulty and learning.


### God of War

In God of War we have different types of bosses, all sharing the cinematic spectacularity, ending explicit executions.

There are bosses that are more powerful enemies and with an intelligence superior to normal, we also have bosses that could be considered one with the stage, like the dragon of God of War 4 that you have to defeat using some bombs that are on the stage that will break his shield and allow him to end it, therefore, this example resembles Bowser, being an enemy impossible to defeat without the environment.

Finally we have gods, which mostly have characteristics similar to those of the player and will be like a fight against someone similar to the protagonist and therefore matched in terms of conditions. This type of boss is usually the most complicated since you have to use your full potential against someone with your same advantages. What usually differentiates it from the protagonist, in addition to being controlled by AI, is that they have to have a weak point that makes us be able to overcome it, such as a loading time for an attack.

The biggest drawback that I see the fighting against bosses of God of War but I think is quite well resolved in the last title, is that there are many automatic combos in which you just have to press the button that indicates the game itself.


## Conclusion of the analysis

Having analyzed all these video game bosses, what are most abundant are these types of bosses:

* Stage bosses: They need the stage to be able to exist and without them they cannot be defeated and they are one with him to perform their movements.
* Rival boss: They have conditions and skills similar to those of the protagonist.
* Super enemy: They are enemies with a more complex pattern than others, they have more stamina and power. They are independent of the scenario although in some cases they may benefit or affect them.
* Exam bosses: They are enemies that are used for the player to master a specific mechanic.
* New mechanic bosses: In the fight against this boss you are granted a new power or object that you will use to defeat him and will make the game different from the rest.

The keys to a good boss design are:

- Epicity
- Climax in history and gameplay
- Challenge
- Goal to achieve
- Reward defeating it

## How to develop a Good Boss

After seeing different bosses and extracted which types of bosses are, let's design a good boss for a game. 

When developing a good boss design, we have to take into account the role it should have in our game because it hasn't the same function a boss in arcade games and in narrative games.

First of all, we have to have clear in our mind that a boss is not another enemy more. It is in the climax of each world or in the final of the game.

The best way to reward the player's work is to test all the mechanics he has acquired during the adventure, showing that by winning it means he has completely mastered them.

The boss has to be a challenge for the player and therefore necessarily has to be difficult, since if you have reached him it is assumed that you have had to go through different challenges that have allowed you to continue until you reach that point. In the event that the boss is simple, the player will feel a void because he has been honing his skills and finally they have not been tested.

Depending on the type of game, the boss needs to have an important weight when it comes to narrative in case it is a game with a story. In the event that the game is Arcade, it must be demonstrated that he is the boss giving weight to his presence.

Epicity is a factor that has become increasingly important thanks to the evolution of technology and is accompanied in some cases by narrative weight, taking advantage of cinematographic factors during the film.

Once the boss is defeated, in the case of the sub-bosses, the player is usually rewarded with some object or simply by allowing him to access a new world.
